TODO:
* ability to update bot settings (/update):
    - you can update the bot's setting (see all the configurable settings in the 
    /setup command)

* how to store the bot's settings for multiple guilds -- will we need a database?

* When the commands are added/updated/removed, these updates should be pushed out
to all guilds, not just the dev server


* handling bot shutdowns. When the bot goes offline, the timer that controls when
people are unmuted, unbanned, etc. is lost. How should we deal with this?

* temp_ban command: bans the user from the server temporarily


COMPLETED:
* hosting the bot on the cloud
* ability to setup the bot (/setup):
    - you pick which roles get to use the commands, or if you want to create the
    role
    - you pick the role for muted people, or if you want to create one
    - the timeout time when you are interacting with the bot
